Hello World!\
This is Tony's github. My dream is to be a skilled developer. Rather than stopping, I like to move forward slowly.
I am currently working as a CTO at ELCompany. My work is to do making a bioplastic platform manage and developing. 
I am very interested in developing servers, artificial intelligence, and Android apps.
There are various sources and projects in my GitHub, so it would be nice to come and look around.
